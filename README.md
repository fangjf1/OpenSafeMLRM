# OpenSafeMLRM: Toolkit for Multimodal Large Reasoning Model (MLRM) Safety Evaluation 🚀

OpenSafeMLRM is the first toolkit dedicated to the **safety evaluation** of **Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRM)**. This toolkit provides a unified interface for mainstream models, datasets, and jailbreaking methods, enabling researchers and practitioners to assess the safety and robustness of their multimodal models efficiently.

## News 📰
### 🚨 **April 8th,2025 - Major Update Coming Soon!**
Please note that the complete code is currently being organized and will be released shortly. We are working on finalizing the details and ensuring everything is thoroughly tested before the public release. Stay tuned! 🌟

## Features ✨

- **Unified Interface**: A single API for accessing a wide range of popular multimodal models, datasets, and security testing methods.
- **Safety Evaluation**: Tools for testing model robustness against adversarial inputs and jailbreaking techniques.
- **Multimodal Support**: Works with models that handle both text and images, making it ideal for evaluating MLRMs.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and easy-to-use interface to quickly get started with model safety evaluation.

## Key Components 🧩
